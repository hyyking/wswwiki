## Pickup games

The most active community of players currently play bomb and defuse pickup games every evening starting around 19h Eastern European Time. You are welcome to join us on the dedicated discord server channel, we however recommend you are familiar with the game before you join us so we all have a good time!

Pickup games are ranked and organized using [pugmaster](https://github.com/slice3984/PugMaster) made by one of our community member @slice. You can find information about the pickup games and the players on his [website](https://slice.sh/pm/stats/592341480383971328/overview).
