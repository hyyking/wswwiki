# Config files

On startup, the game will load the default config file located at <code> [basewsw](../beginner/faq.md#where-do-i-find-my-config--demos--screenshots--etc)/config.cfg </code>.

In the config file you can set game variables such as modifying [player models](./customization/players_teams.md), [video settings](./customization/video.md), [sound](./customization/sound.md) settings and more.

## Example config file

```text
seta name yellowsupercar    // sets your in-game name
seta clan lambo             // sets your in-game clan name
```

## Executing config files

You can create standalone configuration files in your [basewsw](../beginner/faq.md#where-do-i-find-my-config--demos--screenshots--etc) directory that can then be executed at your will in the console using the `exec` command.
