# Health & Armor

Health and armor are the two resources that can represent a players ability to take before they are eliminated.

## Health

Health represents how much damage a player can sustain before they are eliminated. In Warsow, players start with 100 health points, and can increase their health up to a maximum of 200 points.

Health can be replenished with [health items](./items.md#health-items), including:
- [Health vials](./items.md#health-vials): These are smaller than health bubbles and restore 5 health points each.
- [Health bubbles (25hp)](./items.md#health-bubble-25hp): These are small orbs that restore 25 health points when picked up.
- [Health bubbles (50hp)](./items.md#health-bubble-50hp): These are small orbs that restore 50 health points when picked up.
- [Mega Health](./items.md#mega-health): This power-up increases a player's maximum health to 200 points and fully restores their health.

## Armor

Armor is a protective layer that absorbs part of the damage before it affects a player's health.

In Warsow, players can pick up four different types of [armor items](./items.md#armor-items):

- [Armor shards](./items.md#armor-shards): This provides 5 points of armor protection up to 200 armor.
- [Green armor](./items.md#green-armor): This provides 50 points of armor protection up to 100 armor.    
- [Yellow armor](./items.md#yellow-armor): This provides 75 points of armor protection up to 125 armor.
- [Red armor](./items.md#red-armor): This provides 100 points of armor protection up to 150 armor.

Armor is represented by a blue bar that appears above a player's health bar. When a player takes damage, 2/3rds of the damage goes to the armor before damaging health. If a player runs out of armor, any additional damage they take will affect their health directly.
