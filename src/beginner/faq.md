# Q&A

## What does Warsow mean?

- First of all, Warsow was a reference to Joy Division. They were a British post-punk band of late 70's and early 80's previously named Warsaw (with an A, as in the capital of Poland).
- Warsow quickly turned into an acronym: Warriors of Alternate Reality - Slaughters Over the Web.
- SoLomoNK wasn't totally satisfied by the acronym and during the ongoing development searched for a new one. One which would bring a real and strong message...
- Finally, years after, a new acronym was born. One that matches perfectly with Warsow's spirit: <i><b>Warsow is the Art of Respect and Sportsmanship Over the Web</b></i>

## Is Warsow still in development?

The game has migrated from being developed by a dedicated team to becoming a community driven project. Nowadays some work is done by @mwaga to update the game engine and implement new features. As of 2023 he is working on a potential new release for the game which would modernize the game. You can find more information in the dedicated channel on discord.
