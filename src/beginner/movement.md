# Movement

At its core, the movement system, in Warsow is based on techniques called ["bunny hoping"](#bunny-hopping) and ["strafe jumping"](#strafe-jumping). The speed unit in Warsow is referred as *ups* which stands from "units per second".

## Special command
The `special` (bound to mouse2) command makes your character perform a dash, this command can be used in various ways:

- When Using the `special` command from standstill, will perform a dash and instantly give you a base speed of 450 ups.
- You can use the `special` command at any speed, when done correctly you will not lose speed.
- Holding the `special` command before landing allows you to change directions on landing instantly. Either in the direction you're facing or the direction of your direction keys.
- Using the `special` command when against vertical terrain lets you bounce off it (also know as wall-jumping), giving you a small vertical boost.
- The `special` command has a cooldown of 1s on the ground and and 1.5s when wall-jumping.

## Strafe jumping

Strafe jumping is the most used technique to gain speed.
To strafe jump, hold the jump and forward key. Then, alternate between: (while still holding jump and forward)
- holding the left key while moving your mouse to the left.
- holding the right key while moving your mouse to the right.

You can also strafe against a wall (wall strafing). Sometimes this is preferred because it requires less precise mouse movements. Simply perform the strafe in the direction the wall is and hold it.

## Bunny hopping

Bunny hopping is a technique to gain speed in corners. It's similar to strafe jumping, except you don't hold the forward key.
To bunny hop, smooth mouse movement is important.

Start by looking in the direction you are moving. Then, either:
- holding the left key while moving your mouse to the left.
- holding the right key while moving your mouse to the right.

## Sliding

Some surfaces are slick (they are not always super obvious) such as uphill ramps. The fastest way of gaining speed on slick surfaces is exactly the same as bunny hopping. The speed at which you move the mouse is a lot faster however. With a well timed slide you can extend the range of your jump, on some maps allowing for cool movement tricks to access highgrounds.

## Ramp boosting

When you land on a ramp that is going downhill, your vertical speed will be turned into horizontal speed.
