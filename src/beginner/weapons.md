<img src="../static/gunblade.jpg" >

When fired the upgraded gunblade launches a small projectile dealing AOE damage in a small area.

#### Strategy

- The melee damage from the gunblade can be useful to finish off an enemy that is low and is in close range as you will have a harder time hitting them consistently with the other weapons.
- The AOE damage from the upgraded gunblade inflicts self-damage so you can use it to increase your speed or perform a rocket jump.


##  Machinegun

<div align="center">

##  Grenade Launcher

<div align="center">
<img src="../static/grenade_launcher.jpg" >
</div>

#### Description

The grenade launcher is a projectile weapon that fires explosive grenades. It's a powerful weapon that can deal significant damage to both enemies and the environment. The grenades are affected by gravity, which means players need to adjust their aim to compensate for the arc of the grenade's flight. The grenades bounce off walls and other surfaces before detonating. This allows skilled players to use the grenades to hit enemies around corners or behind cover. 

#### Strategy

- The grenades have a small blast radius, so players need to aim accurately to hit their target.
- The grenade launcher has a slow rate of fire, which means players need to carefully time their shots.
- The grenade launcher can also be used to rocket jump, which involves firing a grenade at the ground beneath the player's feet to propel themselves into the air.
- It can be risky to use in close-quarters combat, as the grenades can cause self-damage.

##  Rocket Launcher

<img src="../static/rocket_launcher.jpg" >
</div>

The damage dealt will decreased with the distance of the enemy to the rocket's explosion, dealing a minimum of damage after a certain range.

#### Strategy

- The rocket launcher has a moderate rate of fire, which means players need to carefully time their shots.
- You can shoot at the feet of your opponents to launch them into the air, making them easier to hit with other weapons like the [electrobolt](#electrobol).
- The rocket launcher can also be used to rocket jump, which involves firing a rocket at the ground beneath the player's feet to propel themselves into the air.
- It can be risky to use in close-quarters combat, as the rockets can cause self-damage.

- Spam chokepoints to prevent enemies from reaching a specific area as they will have to go through the stream of plasma to reach you.

</div>

#### Description

The weapons fires a continuous beam of energy that deals continuous damage to enemies as long as it's hitting them. However the beam has a limited range and can only travel a short distance before dissipating. This means players need to be close to their targets to use the laser gun effectively.

#### Strategy
