# Bomb and Defuse

There are 2 teams. One team attacks, and the other defends. At halftime the tasks are swapped and attackers become defenders.
If you are attacker, the goal of your team is to place a bomb in one of the 2 spots marked as A or B before the time reaches zero. One member of the team is given the bomb, the other members escort him to one of the bomb spots. You can see the A and B symbols on the screen which help you reaching the spots.
When the player with the bomb reaches the spot the bomb is dropped, and a circle appears around it. One player of the attacker team (not necessarily the bomb carrier) has to touch that circle until the bomb is armed. Once the bomb is armed their mission is to stop the defenders from disarming it before it explodes. If it explodes the attackers win.
When playing as defender your mission is to stop attackers from planting/arming the bomb. If they get to arm it, any member of the defender team can defuse it by touching the circle around the bomb. If the bomb is disarmed, the defenders win.
If every defender dies the attackers win. If every attacker dies and the bomb hasn't been armed, the defenders win.
