# Race

The main goal for race is to get from the start line to the end line of the map in the fastest time possible. Each map has its own leaderboard so the goal is to practice your movement and the map to be one of the fastest players to complete the map.

Here are some key features of Race mode:

- The timer starts when you hit the start line. You are allowed to do 1 dash, 1 jump and 1 walljump before hitting the start line. If you do any more, you will get a 'Prejump' warning and automatically respawn.
- Before you hit the startline, you can also save a new spawning position to make your life a little bit easier. You can either bind this to a key (see menu) or use the quickmenu. (see *commands* section)
- To gain speed, you combine strafe jumping with other techniques. Your goal is to find a route that allows you to gain the most speed and gets you to the finish line the fastest. (see [movement](../beginner/movement.md) section)
- When you hit a checkpoint you'll be presented with a time and the rank your time is currently at (this compares with checkpoints from other players). If you have completed the race before, there will also be a time difference from your personal best run.
- At the end of your race run, you will get the "race finished" award. Additionally, there will be a race report in chat & console.


## Practice mode

- Practicing can be very useful in longer maps or maps with tricky jumps. To enter `practicemode`, you can either bind it to a key (see menu) or use the quickmenu. In `practicemode`, your races will NOT count. So make sure you leave `practicemode` to actually do a race run.
- While in `practicemode`, you can fly around the map using `noclip` mode. You can either bind this to a key (see menu) or use the quickmenu. (see *commands* section)
- When you find a spot that you want to practice, you can save your position to always respawn there. You can either bind this to a key (see menu) or use the quickmenu. (see *commands* section)
- Additionally, in `practicemode` you can set a speed to spawn with. (see *commands* section) Note: when you save your position on the ground, your speed will get lost immediately.
